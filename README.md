NGDBSCAN
=======

We present NG-DBSCAN, an approximate density-based clustering algorithm that can operate with arbitrary similarity metrics.
The distributed design of our algorithm makes it scalable to very large datasets; its approximate nature makes it fast, yet capable of producing high quality clustering results. We provide a detailed overview of the various steps of NG-DBSCAN, together with their analysis. Our results, which we obtain through an extensive experimental campaign with real and synthetic data, substantiate our claims about NG-DBSCANâ€™s performance and scalability.
